        <h4>Playspots is India’s leading Sports recreational platform for Venues, academies and Individuals.
          We couldn’t believe there was no one-stop shop for sports players looking to find, contact and book local sports turfs. we set about researching, getting support for and then building a platform that showed all sports venues anywhere in south India, and that was free and easy for anyone to use.We know the urban work-life balance isn’t always easy to juggle and our services takes the hassle away from finding places and co- players
          Our mission is making it easier for everyone to play sports and increasing the utilisation of facilities as a result.
          Sports play a pivotal role in bringing people together, sharing moments and enhancing the well-being are reasons that form the  essence of PlaySpots.
          Our Goal is making the sports simple #LetTheWorldPlay</h4>
